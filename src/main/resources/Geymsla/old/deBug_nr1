Since the SamplePack class is responsible for importing and storing the samples, you could consider moving the sorting of files and the creation of Media objects to a separate method within the class.
This way, the importFolder method would have a single responsibility of importing the samples.
Instead of using an array of Sample objects, you could utilize a List<Sample> in the SamplePack class.
This would allow for more flexibility in managing the samples and avoid fixed-size array limitations.
